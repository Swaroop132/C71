    <p class="text-muted">St. Francis Xavier Church, commonly referred to as Bejai Church, is a historic Roman
      Catholic Church situated in the Bejai locality of Mangalore. The church was built in 1869 on a plot of land
      measuring 5.37 acres at Bejai, which was obtained from the British government on 21 November 1869. The
      original structure was a chapel from which Sunday masses were offered</p>

      <p class="text-muted">The college stage and auditorium that you see today, has come through a historic process of
        evolution and gradual transformation. The earliest roots of this stage goes back to the ‘Sans Soucci Theatre’,
        which was burned down by fire in 1843. But the spirit of Sans Soucci survived the holocaust, and in 1859, when
        the premises became the property of Belgain Jesuits, who called it St. Xavier’s, theatre came to life again. The
        St. Xavier’s stage found a place of pride in the cultural life of Calcutta.

        consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus
        with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and
        parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be
        provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and
        any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can
        eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike.
        Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Implemented Online Attendance Management
        System: This informs parents about their child's/children's activities in the school, instantly. Once a student
        reaches the school, the parents will be informed about the status via text messages. This helps schools keep a
        record of the students’ absenteeism. Students can mark the attendance by logging in, and this is stored in a
        database, which can later be checked by the Admin. The tracker has so much potential that it can identify which
        students are irregular to their classes and not ready to establish connectivity with the actual concepts of
        their curriculum’s subjects. As soon as you enter a student’s Enrollment Number or Name, details like
        availability in classes, number of lectures attended will be displayed and no proxies are possible since the
        tracker is supported by cloud capabilities. Even the security offered can be so robust and powerful that those
        students who always fool their deans are caught in a shorter span – just after the admin enters login details
